### Steps on how to create GitHub Page

To create a GitHub Page:

1.  Ensure that you have a **public** repository on GitHub. This repository should contain all the necessary files for your website, including your **HTML** and **CSS** files.
2.  Navigate to your repository and go to **Settings**.
3.  On the left sidebar, under the **Code and Automation** section, find and click on **Pages**.
4.  Under the **Branch** section, select your **main** branch and save the settings.
5.  Wait a few minutes for GitHub to process the changes. Once it's ready, your live website link will be available.

### Key takeaways 

Through this exercise, I realized how intricate and detail-oriented web development can be. It’s not just about writing code—it involves careful **planning, design, and execution**. From selecting the right aesthetics to structuring the layout, every step requires effort. Prior to this exercise, I am already interested in UI/UX design but through this experience, I have learned to appreciate it more.
